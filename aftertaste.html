    <pre class="story-text">
        You taste happiness for the first time on the subway platform, where the air smells like rust and damp newspapers—a bright flavor in a world of grime and flickering lights. The stick of gum rests in your palm, waiting before your tired eyes. You unwrap it slowly, your fingers clumsy though you try not to tear it.

        The platform is almost empty, except for a man reading a crumpled newspaper on a wooden bench. He’s a few feet away from you and very absorbed in his newspaper, but for some reason, you think he might be watching you.

        You don’t know how to feel about that. You wish people would pay more attention to you, but you also fear that they will see your flaws.

        Simply put, you are <em>unhappy.</em>

        You drop the silver foil, mesmerized by the beautiful pink shade of bubblegum that had been wrapped in it. This—this lodestar could give you what you’ve been missing ever since your life went silent. 
	
        You slide it onto your tongue, and the world shifts.

        The gum pops, sugar spilling in your mouth until you feel sparks on the surface of your irises. Your ribs rattle with rhythm, and your breath is louder than ever before—it is clear to you that you are <em>alive</em>. A hot pink breeze slithers into your nostrils, tickling every hair… prickling every nerve. A laugh somewhere makes itself large and warm in your chest, and you realize, astonishingly, that it is yours.

        You close your eyes and chew once, then twice.

        Everything is soft. 

        You are soft.

        You are <em>enough.

        But the thought that it might not last sits just beneath your tongue. Even now, you can feel yourself holding onto it too tightly.</em>

		        	*		*		*

        You chew harder, hungrier, grinding the sweetness to a pulp, as if you can wring every drop of joy into your teeth.

	    The train rocks, and your chest rises and falls as the sweetness pulses beneath your skin. The poles shimmer, the roof stretching into a sky of cadmium yellow. You reach out, but your hand meets a coil of warmth, slick and humming with light. It bends slightly, and your arm seems to bend with it. Your skin envelops the metal—drinking, soaking—until you can taste it. Honey lingers faintly on the tip of your tongue, goosebumps rising on your skin.

	    The floor shakes, and vibrations bloom in waves of vermillion and teal. Your spine is a delicate string of light, and your body sways as the gum pops. The taste is even brighter than when it first kissed your tongue—laced with candied citrus and storm clouds dissolving on your teeth.

        You press your palms to another pole. It ripples like molten bronze, and again the flavor floods you, sugar sliding through your bones. You glance around—other passengers stare at their phones, indifferent, while your entire world explodes in color. You are alone in this kaleidoscope. 

        Your body is porous, color itself seeping into your skin.

        The brightness balloons until it nearly blinds you. Every surface glows fiercely, spilling into the cracks between your teeth as your eyes are forced shut. You brace yourself against the pole, but its pulse climbs—writhingly, sinuously—racing up your spine like it knows how badly you’re trying to catch hold of this moment.

        Then, the train slows. A hush of smoke drifts in, and for a moment, the colors flicker. You try to tap the rhythm—to mimic the train’s vibrations—but for some reason, you can’t even remember it. You chew faster, searching, twisting the gum in your mouth, but the pulse is fading.

        Faces drift past. Not faces, to be exact, but prisms: glimpses of human shapes refracting into rainbow shards. Emerald eyes, amber hair, violet scarves—they move too fast, and you want to devour them, hold them inside your chest like treasure. You inhale greedily, hoarding the sweetness. But when you exhale, it slips through your ribs, leaving a fierce ache in your chest.

        By the time you notice the train slowing, something solid beneath your feet reminds you that the world exists outside this stolen moment. The colors have dulled. You slump against the pole, muscles unwinding like ribbons. The melody returns, but it is faint and thin where it had once been lush. You do not mind. The gum still sweetens the back of your throat. It always does.

        You can hardly remember how many times you’ve done this—hop on the train, pop a stick of gum, feel alive. A thought lingers like a sour note: <em>this spark will end soon.</em> You ignore it.

        When your stop arrives, you don’t leave. 

        You just laugh, the world spinning as the gum’s flavor drools all over you.

		        	*		*		*

        You weren’t laughing. That was the first thing you realized when you came back to yourself: the sound in your throat wasn’t yours. It belonged to the gum, or maybe the promise inside it, cracking open and spilling everywhere. The brilliance faded, leaving a residue that tingled sharply against your tongue. 

        You chew again.

        You wrap the gum around your tongue and press it to the roof of your mouth like you could force it deeper in, as if that might hold its world inside you longer. 

        You tell yourself it’s just tonight. You tell yourself you won’t. You tell yourself a lot of things while your hands peel open foil. 

        Between mouthfuls, you watch the ordinary world carry on: a woman folds an umbrella, her son pressing his face to her jacket. They talk in soft, complete sentences. It makes your chest pinch because you remember you used to be able to hold entire conversations with people too. You used to laugh in a way that didn’t feel borrowed. 

        You look down at your hands, and you see them shaking. You will them to stop, your eyes wavering at the sight, but they don’t. Instead, they reach for another pack, the dirty wrappers crinkling in your bag as you dig for more. 

        Your body betrays you. You cram another piece of gum into your mouth as tears sting your eyes. Your lips curve into a smile, just like they always have, but your heart beats fast, begging you to run. You loathe the dampness sliding down your cheeks, but you hate even more that you can’t stop reaching for another stick.

        You love the way it tastes.

        But you’re scared.

		        	*		*		*

        You’re familiar with the pattern now. The highs arrive like fireworks and always end the same: with the loud, shameful echo of hollowness. 

        One night on the platform, you press a new stick to your tongue, and a child with chocolate at the corners of his mouth looks up at you. His laugh is simple, immediate, affixed to him like a patch. You feel both envy and a stab of sorrow: even this small thing, a laugh, is not yours to keep.

        You keep chewing. You keep walking. You keep losing. Each bright taste betrays you by vanishing before you can learn its outline. Sometimes, though rarely, you can name what’s missing. It is a louder sound, a voice at a table, warm bread, the way someone leaned in the dark and whispered, <em>I love you.</em> The gum gives you flashes of that voice, but never the room that contains it. It gives you the shimmer of light on a table, but not the hands that set the plates down.

        On the train, under the yellow light, you catch your reflection in the window of the subway car. Your eyes are torn open, cheeks wizened, mouth stained with sugar. You are a small-time smuggler, trafficking in brief illuminations. The things you keep—the wrappers and your practiced excuses—are evidence of the crime. You tried to pass off these stolen moments as life.

        The finale is not dramatic. There is no great cliff, no last delirium. There is only the same tiny crack: an arrival, a brightness, then the soft, inevitable seep back to gray. You stand on an empty platform once more and press the last stick into your mouth. It flares, incandescent and obscene. For a few seconds—seconds that feel like entire moons—you taste other people’s laughter, a sun that is warm and whole.

        It collapses.

        The light retracts. You swallow, and there is nothing left but the aftertaste of wanting. The platform is colder than when you arrived. The man with the crumpled paper folds it more carefully now. He has not moved—not because he is indifferent, but because to him, silence is a kind of mercy: it does not require you to explain the hollow feeling that sits in the back of your throat.

        You curl your fingers around the empty wrapper. It is soft and limp, already losing the shape it once promised. Into your pocket, you fold the wrapper—a talisman that won’t ward anything off.

        Your hands remember how to be small again. You know, with a clarity that is almost kind, what you have been: a person who mistook temporary sweetness for a feast. You will chew tomorrow. You will chew the day after. You will keep chewing because the alternative is knowing that joy can be shown to you—and still not be yours.

        You chew because you are afraid of losing joy.

        You chew because you never had joy to begin with.

        The taste is gone. The wanting is not.
