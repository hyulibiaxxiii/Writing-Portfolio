    <pre class="story-text">
        Many days have passed, and all I have been doing is painting. The result is that I am confused. The white canvas on my drafting table is empty like a Christmas tree without any ornaments. The paper is filled with subjects like trees, flowers, and grass. And yet it is missing an object of incredible significance. Splotches of indigo and sage green stain my floor, and a cadmium yellow oil paint is dried on my cheek. The gray walls of my room whisper to me to give up, telling me that I will never create what I want.
     	Before the sun sets, I walk around the fields with Cheryl, a friend I’ve known for a while. She wears a white shirt full of mismatched flowers and birds, as if painted by an inexperienced artist. Her pants are also of a million assortments of flowers, and she is wearing strange cowboy boots. As we walk through the fields, she plucks a dandelion and stares at it with sparkling eyes. Her usual hazel pupils brighten; on the glossiness of her irises, there are stars. It’s as though she’s never seen a dandelion before. Seconds later, the flower is in her mouth. She laughs at my expression and tells me of its bitter taste, only to continue eating it. She swallows and scrunches her face at the tickly texture from the petals, yet smiles shortly after, whistling to herself.
     	Cheryl has an erratic aura. Still whistling that quaint melody, she lays down on the pea-green grass with her eyes closed, breathing in the tranquility of the mid-day air. The song she is whistling gives me a tingly feeling in my legs. I am nearly persuaded to whistle it along with her.
     	I tell her we must move on, yet she is already rolling perfectly like a log down the lively green hills of grass and flowers. Leaves begin to stick in her hair, and dirt stains her clothes.
     	I chase Cheryl down the glistening hills and find myself closer to the horizon. She spreads her arms wide, and her dirt-covered back gleams as the sun’s beaming curtain falls leisurely on her.
     	Trees waver with a quiet zephyr, and the distant noise of children playing in another field slips through my ears. The sky is filled with colors — a warm orange blending with periwinkle and splotches of cerulean. I realize that these colors are precisely what was missing in my painting. The transitioning afternoon, the peace I feel with Cheryl. As the sun was the opening music to the twilight, she was the color of my art.
