    <h1 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Before the Kantō Massacre</h1>
    <pre class="story-text">
        I dip the paintbrush into gold dew, skimming it gently across the canvas with a relaxed stroke. Small streaks of white shape the cracks along the surfaces of the mountains in the distance with their sharp, rigid edges. They just barely reach the top of the canvas, and the sun appears to kiss the faint gray clouds that reside as fog amidst the hanok below. With more tones of white, the humid atmosphere that my mother once spoke about during my childhood takes form. “The beautiful thing about Joseon, Baeyeong, is that the summer air carries the scent of water, even when it doesn’t rain. The cicadas are always singing, their hum a beautiful melody bringing us together — not nearly the same as life here. Just the smell of air mixed with the scent of water makes you yearn; it leads to sacrifices,” she’d told me.                                     
	    In the center of my wooden canvas stands a girl, wrapped in her solitude, her lips curled proudly yet gently at the same time. Her messy black hair flows long and free with the wind, and her eyes shine with a quiet joy. She looks alone — too stubborn to give to others, yet too proud to take as well. My sister is young, blooming, but seemingly defenseless; I reach out my hand and she grasps it, but not once does she share her emotions with me. 
        Behind her are several more canvases, some filled with mountains shrouded in mist, and temples surrounded by the beauty of amber trees. The leaves at this time are slowly shifting to an orange shade, but I know that at some point they will fall to the ground and become nothing more than dust. Other paintings show soft fields of wheat waving with the rough winds of the monsoon season, speckles of raindrops brushing against them. Elsewhere, fog wraps itself around the tall strands of grass. When I look at the canvases, I relive my memories, relive the monsoon of my childhood in the fields of the Musashino Plain.
	    Suddenly, a strange sound rings in my ear that seems distant but so close at the same time, like an eddy that never calms. The wooden desk begins to shake, the paint brushes rattle in the small cups. I turn in confusion when the paintings on the wall start to sway. Before I can think more, I look up and <em>the roof is falling.</em>
	    At the sight, I jump from my chair and leave everything, climbing through the window panel, trying not to tear the shoji between the frames when I suddenly hear something ripping. My head whips around to see the fusuma doors behind me collapsing, the wood snapping with each passing second. Mind pulsing, I decide to jump from the window and land onto the cold, trembling concrete when I notice people shouting and crying out to one another.
	    Families huddle on the ground, cowering in fear as more houses crumble to bits. Cries ripple through the air. I turn frantically, searching for my sister’s messy hair and round eyes amongst the crowds of people huddling together in fear and confusion. The ground shakes, cracks forming across the surface of the cold road, everything in the world turning upside down. Each house splits one by one, telephone wires getting tangled around the debris crashing to the floor. The tiles of the curved roofs slide to the floor with a clank, stone pillars unable to keep the structures from being reduced to rubble. I stand amidst the wreckage of shattered homes and broken tiles, eyes struggling to stay open as my head burns with a growing fear. 
	    The clouds floating above my head continue to drift away as time passes on without a care. I tremble, taking coverage under a little table from the café that has already crumbled to bits, when a small child scrambles to hide beside me. My eyes begin to fog from both the dust piling up in the air and the pain throbbing in my head. The child starts shrieking like a hiyodori bird, and I grab his arms to stop him from leaving the safety of the table. His screams are replaced by sobs calling for his mother, and I hold him tight to calm him down, just like I did for my sister when she cried for my father, who died working in the mines. 
	    The two of us sit beneath the table, and the child trembles, yet refuses to return to the piles of debris to search for his parents. In my head I see my sister, buried under the remains of our home, and I know I have to go. I gulp before sprinting away from the table, the boy’s shrieks now distant. 
        My memory is hazy, and it is hard to know what direction leads to our home when all the houses beside it have been reduced to dust. There’s nothing left for me to doubt, though, so I run. The concrete beneath me shakes, parts of it splitting as the weight of the air pushes against me. Gales of wind thrust my hair into my eyes, piles of rock rising from the ground, and my vision is blurred. My eyes are not my legs, though, so I run. The houses are still collapsing on one another, and I can no longer tell if the ground shakes from their weight or from the earthquake. I feel my body getting heavier each moment, my arms weighing on my shoulders, and my legs moving, yet as if anchored to the earth. Eventually, through the bit of light in my vision, I see our home.	
        Rubble.
        My eyes move uncontrollably, searching and calling for my sister. My hands toss mounds of rubble aside, my heart beating fast, screaming with the hope that I don’t find her underneath. Blood drips from the new cuts in my fingers, but I hardly feel the pain. I shove the countless wooden chairs and tables and shattered glass frames aside, finding nothing but more rubble and more debris. That’s when I notice a hanbok doll covered with dust lying on the cold floor; her smile is still radiant, her vibrant robes hidden by the clouds of rust covering it. 

        <em>A bush warbler sings in the distance…
        “That’s how you know it’s spring, Areum,” I say. “You can hear their song. It’s really hard to see one as often as hear them. But if you stay very quiet…”
        I notice that Areum is hardly paying attention, her hands clutching two dolls — one a prince, the other a princess. The prince is dressed in a bright blue hanbok embroidered with golden flowers, while the princess wears a green one with strips of vibrant fuchsia, yellow, and a lighter blue. Areum’s eyes gleam with excitement as she moves the prince to kiss the princess, her story unfolding in her mind. 
        I look up to see Areum suddenly digging through Mother’s closet, pulling out several old traditional dresses that she no longer wears—or rather, refuses to. She begins to cut the fabric into smaller shapes and wrap them around her dolls, and her eyes widen in satisfaction. 
        With her two dolls bundled in their new outfits, Areum slides the fusuma open. I gasp at the splotches of rose oil paint newly spilled on the floor. Across the room stands Mother, unaware of what Areum is up to. Suddenly, the scent of sizzling chijimi on the surface of a hot pan reaches my nose. It looks just like as I remember it: a warm flat pancake with batter and eggs and vegetables like pepper, green onions, squash, with fish, and some shrimp. Chijimi is Korean, different from okonomiyaki, which is made by Zainichi – or Korean-Japanese – for the Japanese market. In okonomiyaki, you can hardly distinguish the different tastes of the vegetables and the shrimp — the entire pancake is covered in a sauce that blends every ingredient together. It is more fierce, more confident, and yet less authentic; the true beauty of the dish is concealed by the sauce. 
        “Areum, don’t make a mess now,” I say gently, calling her over to sit with me so I can tell her about the beauty of spring again. 
        It seems as though she doesn’t hear me, and her hands pat the fabric delicately to remain in place. She dips a brush into the palette that she filched from my room, and paints a light blush onto the princess’ pale cheeks. I stare down at the empty white page in the sketchbook my father had bought me. For days, I didn’t know what to put in it, so now I pretend that it was never there in the first place. But there sits my younger sister, enveloped in her own world, sitting only a few feet away from me yet floating away, blending in with the blooming sakura blossoms.
        I quickly grab my graphite pencil and start sketching. By the time I am finished, I hear my mother and sister in the kitchen.
	    “Areum, look at the mess you’ve made!” Mother exclaims. “I’ve told you so many times that you should do this in your room…” Her eyebrows furrow and her lips knot tightly. “That’s Baeyeong-oppa’s paint, isn’t it? I bought that for your brother, don’t bother his supplies, please!” Her voice cracks a little.
        “Not everything has to be his you know… Uma, look!” Areum cries, waving her dolls in the air while trying to get Mother’s attention. “Look, they have new and better clothes now! I found these in your closet, and now the princess looks like you!” 
        Mother gasps. The traditional hanboks that she had hidden in the back of the closet had been pulled out; the lavender rose cuffs of one were cut off and wrapped around the dolls’ shoulders as a cape. Though Mother had claimed she didn’t want to wear or see the hanboks ever again, I always wondered why she never sold them but instead kept them in the closet. Behind her gaze now, I notice a tsunami of regret, pain, and nostalgia enveloping her mind. Of course the hanboks were still precious to her, but now one had been mutilated. 
        I watch silently as Mother turns paler and picks up the rest of the hanbok; she walks over to her room and closes the fusuma door. Its click sounds louder than usual, but it doesn’t take her long to come out of the room and return to the frying chijimi.
        But while her back is turned on both me and Areum, I notice her hands shaking slightly as she flips the batter in the pan. Just as it sizzles, Mother lets out a sigh. I look closely, noticing how scarred her hands have become. Her slender fingers are no longer pure like they used to be, and her palms are rough and full of sweat. 
        I look down at my sketchbook, my drawing of Areum’s paint splattered-hands vibrant and colorful, just like her face had been when she was creating. I had brushed this off as a childlike joy. But when I looked closely, the light reflecting on her eyes showed me that she is always focused, wrapped in her own world, time passing the way she wants it to in her mind. It’s as though she doesn’t recognize anyone else as they see themselves, and she always feels disconnected. Yet her resolve makes me place my hope in her. 
        Then I look at my next blank page, and in my eyes I already see another painting forming. I start sketching Mother’s hands, rough and scraped from working in the kitchen. I draw Mother’s arms, muscles from carrying all the food. I draw Mother’s eyes, tearing up because she was never appreciated. And then, as I look closer, I almost see Mother’s heart — shattering from the burden of putting her family first, again and again.
	    “Areum!” I call. I slide across the tatami mats, spotting Areum sitting on the floor, sniffling.
        Her small, paint-splattered hands are curled into two fists. 
        I crouch down to where she sits, flipping to the page in my sketchbook with the painting.
        “Look,” I say gently, watching as her eyes widen, then close tightly, her eyebrows furrowed. 
	    Before I can say anything, our father enters the room and I hear the fusuma door slide open, its crisp wooden click. 
        “It’s time for dinner.” He adds, “I won’t be able to join today again, I’m sorry.”
	    Areum looks up, her irises reflecting the morning dew, her eyebrows relaxing and her lips unknotting. She jumps up, rushes over to Father and wraps her arms warmly around him.
	    “Oppa and Uma got mad at me today though,” she says. “Why can’t you join us for dinner just this once?”
	    “I wasn’t mad at you!” I want to say. I quickly swallow my words.
	    Father pulls away from her tight embrace gently, patting her head. His eyebrows relax, and I can almost hear the sadness dripping into his heart. But for some reason, he just gives us another smile before heading to the mines. 
	    “I’ll be back before you fall asleep,” he says, opening the door.	
	    Suddenly, tears cloud my eyes. I didn’t know why. Why was I crying? Why did my heart hurt?
	
        Because he never returned after that.</em>
	
        Nausea washes over my head, and I feel a light flash over my vision before I am there again. There, in front of all the destruction. I gasp, breathing heavily, my dirt-covered hands wrapped around my own torso. Tears spill out from my eyes and the only thing I can think about is my sister.

        <em>Areum.</em>
        <em>Areum.</em>
        <em>Areum!</em>

        I whip my head around, force myself to get up, and drag my feet across the cold cement. I don’t know where she could be, don’t know if she’s okay, don’t know anything. 
        And just as the thoughts come rushing in, the earthquake comes to a halt. Suddenly the ground stops shaking completely, and the pain in my head eases. Everything is done like a wave against the shore of a beach, the ocean of confusion evaporating into the soft clouds. The ground is no longer shaking, but my world is. My world is spinning, collapsing, and breaking down. I think of one last thing — the mine my father worked at.
        He worked so far away from home, so far that it would take more than a whole day to walk there. But Areum knew the direction there by heart;  regardless of how she had learned it, she knew. If she were to go anywhere, she would go there. I am sure of at least that.
        I gasp for another breath of air, my legs sluggish and the gears in my head barely turning. 
        Then my legs throb with immense pain before going entirely numb.
	    A few more steps.
        I find an alley that is half-broken, with piles of debris beside its still-standing walls, and lie there, nearly fainting from exhaustion when I hear something.
	
        “Baeyeong-oppa!”

        A light, familiar voice calls my name; it is filled with a slight sense of worry but mostly calm, even in such a situation. I whip my head around, dizzy, when I meet my sister’s eyes. Her brown irises reflect the blazing sun, shaking ever so gently with the buzzing of the shattering floor. Hand trembling, I reach out for her, pull her into a hug and decide to hope for things to stop. The world has broken with each passing second; it is unfaltering and unclear whether it will heal in the next moment or in the next year. My shoulders tremble, my sister holds me tight as I try my best to count and relax my breathing.
	    “I made something for you,” she says, tears dripping slowly down her rosy cheeks. She helps me up and in front of me, I see a light — a burning flame and a black frying pan on top. 
	    The familiar smell tickles my nose and suddenly I break into tears. Her hands move swiftly as chijimi pancakes flip in the air, and the batter sizzles against the pan. Her hair, tied in a bun, makes her look so much more like our mother. Her radiant smile, even after what happened, reminds me of the hanbok doll I had seen. 
	    “Here you go, oppa!” she exclaims, handing me the warm, newly-made chijimi.	
        “Mmm!” My eyes light up when I taste the familiarity in the pancake. “When did you get so good at cooking, Areum?”
	    She smiles, the warmth of my compliment makes her proud. She takes a bite of her own creation, and her face lights up as well.
	    “It’s a good thing it turned out well,” she says, already done with her serving of chijimi. 
	    Together, we stare up at the glistening sun, and my skin cools from the breeze. Today’s afternoon sky is innocently beautiful — born of the bluest petals stretching against the great expanse of azure emptiness. Then the clouds come into view, like tufty pillows gliding slowly across the limitless sky. I turn my gaze to my sister, who sits peacefully even amidst the chaos the earthquake has left. 
	    But far behind us, there are people screaming, guns echoing through the air, and blood splattering across the floor like the first splotches of paint on a blank canvas. Unbeknownst to us, a massacre is stirring.
